AutoPay Guardian

Autonomous AI Agent Wallet for Subscription Management

🚀 Overview

AutoPay Guardian is an AI-powered agent wallet designed to autonomously manage subscription-based payments.
It protects users from unwanted renewals, inactive subscriptions, and silent financial leakage by enforcing policy-driven spending controls.

Instead of manually tracking subscriptions, the AI agent actively monitors, evaluates, and intervenes in recurring transactions on behalf of the user.

🎯 Problem Statement

Subscription services are convenient but often lead to:

Forgotten active subscriptions

Free trials converting into paid plans

Unused services continuing to charge users

Most wallets only track spending — they don’t act.
AutoPay Guardian addresses this gap by introducing autonomous, explainable financial decision-making.
